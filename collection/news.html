  <b>August 1, 2025:</b> I have finally finished the 'CDs' section of the <a href=weezer-releases>weezer releases</a> page! That will probably be the longest and most detailed individual table on the website, so it's an accomplishment to have it completed. In addition, I've slightly redone the appearance of the table to use a flag icon (instead of an abbreviation) and to include a small thumbnail image of each release! The images will be chosen based on what I think will best represent each individual release, i.e., the back insert artwork for a promo with no front insert, or the CD artwork for albums with multiple very similar variants with no visual differences on the cover.
  <br><br>
  I have also updated the <a href=home>home</a> page to look and read a little nicer, as well as to update the 'stats' section. Behind the scenes, I learned how to use # "anchors" and am now able to link to <a href=weezer-releases#Vinyl>specific</a> <a href=weezer-releases#5-Album-Collection>parts</a> of pages. I've also tried to begin creating graphics for the site, including a logo and a possible header format to replace the current simple text version.
  <br><br>
  Construction continues. I hope to have a decent proportion of the website done before I leave for college in two weeks. We shall see...
