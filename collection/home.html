   <b>Welcome to my Weezer collecting spreadsheet!</b>

   <br><br>

   My name is Burnst Jamp. I've been collecting Weezer media since 2019. I used to keep track of my collection on my <a href=https://www.weezerpedia.com/wiki/User:Burnst_Jamp>Weezerpedia userpage</a>, but it has grown far too large and unruly to maintain there. It is now located here, in the form of HTML spreadsheets, in hopes that this format will preserve ease-of-viewing, ease-of-editing, and allow for the precision necessary to delineate similar releases.

   <br><br>

   This repository has been split into multiple sections roughly analagous to how my collection is sorted in-person: "<a href="weezer-releases.html">Weezer releases</a>", "<a href="associated-releases.html">Associated band releases</a>", "<a href="compilations.html">Compilations</a>", "<a href="tribute-cover-releases.html">Tribute/cover releases</a>", "<a href="bootlegs.html">Bootlegs</a>", and "<a href="non-music.html">Non-music</a>". Each of these categories is divided further by format or band to avoid clutter. I've also included some additional sections ("<a href="signature-gallery.html">Signature gallery</a>", "<a href="favorites.html">Favorite items</a>", and "<a href="wanted">Wanted items</a>") to highlight releases separate from the complete spreadsheet. The "<a href="news.html">News</a>" section will update with changes to the spreadsheet and new additions. Where applicable, I have provided a link to each release's Discogs entry in order to clarify the precise pressing in case the spreadsheet notes do not offer sufficient detail. Since most Discogs entries include scans or photos of their releases, this spreadsheet is text-only and does not include any visuals.

   <br><br>

   This website is inspired by Weezercollector's (now-defunct) website, which was undoubtedly the most comprehensive and impressive repository for Weezer collecting of its time. It is also inspired by Deckra's personal collecting spreadsheet, which he started after his own collection became too big for his Weezerpedia userpage years ago. I can credit my interest in Weezer collecting (and the desire to list and share my collection with the web) to BringHomeTheTurkey's impressive <a href=https://www.weezerpedia.com/wiki/User:BringHomeTheTurkey>Weezerpedia collection list</a>, which seemed impossibly long to me when I began accruing my first CDs.
