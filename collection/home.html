   <b>Welcome to my Weezer collecting spreadsheet!</b>

   <br><br>

   I am Burnst Jamp! I've been collecting Weezer music and memorabilia since ~2020. I used to keep track of my collection on my <a href=https://www.weezerpedia.com/wiki/User:Burnst_Jamp>userpage</a> on Weezerpedia, but it's grown too large and unruly to maintain there. Now it has its own dedicated webpage. I've chosen to organize it in simple HTML tables in hopes that this format will be readable, easy to update, and adequately precise. <b>This site is under construction</b>, so some links may be broken, and many releases are still missing.

   <br><br>

   This repository is split into different sections analagous to how I sort the physical collection: "<a href="weezer-releases.html">Weezer releases</a>", "<a href="associated-releases.html">Associated band releases</a>", "<a href="compilations.html">Compilations</a>", "<a href="tribute-cover-releases.html">Tribute/cover releases</a>", "<a href="bootlegs.html">Bootlegs</a>", and "<a href="non-music.html">Non-music</a>". Each of these categories is divided further by format and/or band. I've also included some additional sections ("<a href="signature-gallery.html">Signature gallery</a>", "<a href="favorites.html">Favorite items</a>", and "<a href="wanted">Wanted items</a>") to highlight specific cool releases. The "<a href="news.html">News</a>" section will update with changes to the website or major new additions.

   <br><br>

For each collection item, the year and country of release are listed (if known), a brief bulleted list and detailed "notes" secion are included to delineate versions of release, a represenative thumbnail is shown, and links to the exact release on Discogs and/or the Weezerpedia Physical Release Catalog are made available. Within tables, releases are ordered chronologically (as accurately as possible), however ALL versions of a given release of the same format are listed adjecently.

   <br><br>

   This website is inspired by Weezercollector's (now-defunct) website, which was undoubtedly the most comprehensive and impressive repository for Weezer collecting of its time. It is also inspired by Deckra's personal <a href=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10DHrrOFAud01wZZRdIP6FWOO_0SsPdkMc3Nl7Pabbkg/edit?gid=450365478#gid=450365478>collecting spreadsheet</a>, which he started after his own collection became too big for his Weezerpedia userpage years ago. I can credit my interest in Weezer collecting (and the desire to list and share my collection with the web) to BringHomeTheTurkey's impressive <a href=https://www.weezerpedia.com/wiki/User:BringHomeTheTurkey>Weezerpedia collection list</a>, which seemed impossibly long to me when I began accruing my first CDs.
